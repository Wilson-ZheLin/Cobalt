# Cobalt

A Modern and Elegant Color Scheme for IntelliJ IDEA ☕️

### Introduction

**Cobalt** is a modern, visually striking color scheme designed for IntelliJ IDEA and the Java language, drawing inspiration from the sleek New UI of Jet Brains IDEs. Dominated by a contemporary shade of blue, **Cobalt** is named after the rich, deep hue of cobalt blue – a color renowned in the realms of art and gemstones, symbolizing *depth* and *stability*.

We believe a simple color scheme can influence a developer's mood, and enhance productivity and creativity. Hope you like it too!
