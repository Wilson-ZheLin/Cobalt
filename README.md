# Cobalt ☕️

**Cobalt** is a modern and elegant color scheme designed for IntelliJ IDEA and the Java language☕️, drawing inspiration from the sleek New UI of Jet Brains IDEs. Dominated by a contemporary shade of blue, **Cobalt** is named after the rich, deep hue of cobalt blue – a color renowned in the realms of art and gemstones, symbolizing *depth* and *stability*.

We believe a simple color scheme can influence a developer's mood, and enhance productivity and creativity. Hope you like it too!
